<h3>Media quota</h3>
<p>
    This quota is allocated to you by the site administrator and allows you to upload a fixed number of streaming media
    episodes. The episodes can be of any size and in any format you like. Once uploaded and commented on by someone, they can only be
    deleted by your course tutor or an administrator (otherwise, marking gets complicated if you keep changing them),
    so take care that you have the right file and it's finished. Contact your tutor if you want to be able to
    upload more episiodes than you are currently allocated.
